Repository for the paper: Efficient Log-based Anomaly Detection with Knowledge Distillation


**Abstract**: Logs are produced by many systems for troubleshooting purposes. Detecting abnormal events is crucial to maintain regular operation and secure the security of systems. Despite the achievements of deep learning models on anomaly detection, it still remains challenging to apply these deep learning models in some scenarios, one popular case that deploying on resources-constrained scenarios such as IoT devices, due to the limitation of computational resources on these devices. We identify two main problems of adopting these deep learning models in practice, including: (1) they cannot deploy on resource-constrained devices because of the size and speed of large models, and (2) they cannot achieve satisfactory detection accuracy with simple models.  In this work, we proposed a novel lightweight anomaly detection method from system logs, DistilLog to overcome these problems. DistilLog utilizes a pre-trained word2vec model to represent log event templates as semantic vectors, incorporated with the PCA dimensionality reduction algorithm to minimize computational and storage burden. The Knowledge Distillation technique is applied to reduce the size of the detection model meanwhile maintaining the high detection accuracy. The experimental results show that DistilLog can achieve high F-measures of 0.964 and 0.961 on HDFS and BGL datasets while maintaining the minimized model size and fastest detection speed. This effectiveness and efficiency demonstrate the potential for widespread use in most scenatios, by showing the ability to deploy the proposed model on resource-constrained systems.

## I. Framework
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Y01YfZs/Framework-of-Distil-Log.png" width="502"><br>An overview of DistilLog</p>

DistilLog consists of the following components:
1. **Preprocessing**: Extracting the log templates using log parser.
2. **Semantic Embedding**: DistilLog extracts the semantic information of log events by applying a pretrained word2vec  model (FastText) then using PCA algorithm for dimensionality reduction.
3. **Classification**: Anomaly detection using a teacher-student architecture-based GRU model with attention. In this step include training student from teacher model via knowledge distillation.

### 4.3. RQ2: Contribution of main components to DistilLog
#### 4.3.1. Knowledge Distillation
We compare DistilLog with other variants: 
- **Teacher**: We directly leverage the large teacher model for the evaluation and report the results
- **DistilLog_NoKD**: We use a model with the same studentâ€™s architecture of DistilLog and train it from
scratch without Knowledge Distillation

- **DistilLog_prune**: Instead of compressing the teacher model with Knowledge Distillation, we utilize model pruning to eliminate the weights with low magnitude from the teacher model
- **DistilLog_quant**: We replace Knowledge Distillation in DistilLog with the quantization technique to represent the weights and activations in the teacher model with lower precision data types (e.g., 8-bit integer)
